## Helping You Pick Your Next Classical Concert

You love music, all kinds of music, and love going to concerts! Except for classical music. Have you looked at a Carnegie Hall program? Or a Lincoln Center calendar? So many composers, so many pieces, so many interpreters! 
The biggest barrier is that it's nearly impossible to figure out what a piece sounds like from just reading a program. 
ClassiCal is a site that scrapes (several) classical music sites and ADDS LINKS to YouTube videos corresponding to the pieces to be performed. It's a one-stop shop to check out what's coming up and discover what it sounds like in order to help you decide
!

- [deployment: TBD]
- [Medium article on my tribulations] 


### Technical value: 
I want to practice 1. dynamic web scraping and 2. dynamic rendering of content.
-- Exploring Puppeteer.js / Cheerio.js and other HEADLESS SCRAPING TOOLS
-- Web Scraping is a great way to re-familirarize myself with HTML/CSS syntax
-- Using REACT for rendering 

#### TOOLS: 

-- React Hooks  
-- Node + Express
-- Puppeteer
-- PostgresQL/MongoDB 
  


### Two-week Sprint Plan: 

#### Week 1a: Scraping 
-- Scraping for ONE element
-- Scraping in loops to render content of an entire site
-- Scraping several sites and rendering

#### Week 1b: Video-Searching
-- Studying protocol for finding RIGHTS-FREE videos

#### Week 2a: Rendering

#### Week 2b: OPTIMIZING youtube video selection


### Overcoming Blockers

#### Blocker 1: Frustration regarding JavaScript scrapers 
JavaCcript scraping tools are just coming of age and most of them have runtime and efficiency issues, especially compared with Python. 

#### Blocker 2: 

#### Blocker 3: 





### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP:
--   

#### PostMVP:

-- Allow user to select a DAY and TIME SLOT for her availability  
-- Allow user to SELECT potential coworking matches via filter   
--  Use YELP or FOURSQUARE APIs to render cafes on map

## API

-- Mapbox API + Uber's ReactMapGL public repo for functionalities

-- Code sample:
```js
<ReactMapGL
            {...this.state.viewport}
            mapboxApiAccessToken = {process.env.REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN}
            mapStyle = 'mapbox://styles/parisny/ck0lefyty5kux1cte8t6fukb6'
            onViewportChange = {(viewport) => this.updateViewport(viewport)}
            onClick = {this.props.mapClick}
          >
            ///MAP will pass other users' locations with a pin, a marker, a radius circle, and a pop-up infowindow
        </ ReactMapGL>
```
